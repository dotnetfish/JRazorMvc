# JRazorMvc
JRazorMvc is a mvc framework. It helps you to build your mvc wabapp with  lots of wonderful features.
#Features:
##1.Route config.
  you can just using the code or cfg to define your route rule.<br>
  the route would looks like this: 
  ```json
  { 
  name:"defaultRoute", 
  pattern:"/{area}/{controller}/{action}", 
  default:[area:"default",controller:"home",action:"index"], 
  packages:["org.superstudio.jrazormvc.demo","org.superstudio.jrazormvc.demo.controllers"] 
  } 
  ```
* name:the route name,it must be unique
* pattern: the url pattern
* default:the default value when the parameters define in pattern is missing
* packages: the route only search for the controllers and actions under the defined packages,when it is empty it look for all

or you can config your routes by coding,you need just init a Route object with parameters,then apply it to route table.
such as 
```java
    Route route = new Route() ;
		route.setArea("");
		route.setName("default");
		route.setUri("/{controller}/{action}.html");
		Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();
		map.put("controller", "home");
		map.put("action", "index");
		route.setParameters(map);
    Routes.mapRoute(route)
```
and it's threadsafe.

##2.JRazorTemplateEngine
a template engine render the dynamic template with compiled java code
the gramma just like c# razorï¼Œbut it runs java
you can define a code block with "@" or output the variable with "@". it's easy if you're good at java,in another way,it is java.
this is a simple template: which will import package and out hello world
```java
@import java.text.MessageFormat; 
<html> 
<head> 
</head> 
<body> 
@* this is comment block,it allows mutilline,the @block in comment block will not be rendered *@ 
@{ 
//this is java code block,you can write comments just like java does 
String name=MessageFormat.format("{0} {1}","",""); 
String who="superstudio";//declare a who varian 

} 
<!--in the say way you can write html comment outside code block--> 
<!--and the line below would output "hellow,superstudio"--> 
Hello,@who 
</body> 
</html> 
```
##3.model binder
